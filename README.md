# Pancakebot-bot
Script using OpenCV to farm pancakes with Discord's Pancakebot. 
Features: Trivia and fishing

Messages from disord captured using OpenCV to determine which regions are Pancakebot messages.
These messages are read with PyTesseract (OCR).

Fishing is implemented through a simple timed loop that checks with OpenCV for a broken fishing rod message.

Trivia is implemented using the OpenTrivia API which has the answers to the questions that PancakeBot asks for trivia.
These trivia questions are parsed with PyTesseract and compares it to the dictionary that I generated by taking information
from the OpenTrivia API.
